# usbpatchd

Patch the USB restriction on iOS, which blocks USB accessories from accessing the device.
This can be used to provide SSH over USB (courtesy of dropbear) from a locked
iOS device.

This is a free alternative to "minaUSB patcher" that is not as buggy or maliciousâ€”there
have been numerous reports of "minaUSB patcher" deleting and hiding files it has no
right to.

Most files in this repository have been aligned similar to the checkra1n bootstrap
(/binpack); as such, the GPLv3 license applies as labelled in the [License section](#license)
to only the files that I have written (and therefore claim copyright on).

## Using
1. Boot into an SSH ramdisk capable of SSH and mounting the System volume
    * A ramdisk capable of such can be created through a free public tool
    created by u/meowcat454 which can be found
    [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20220812002341/https://www.reddit.com/r/setupapp/comments/w1irgx/how_to_boot_a_ssh_ramdisk_on_64bit_devices/)
    (instructions may not be provided, but it should be simple enough).
2. Run `install-usbpatchd.sh` from Terminal and follow any instructions.

## Notes
* You will have to run some manual commands. This shouldn't be too difficult.
I will try to improve this to let snappy run automatically in the future.
* This is a work in progress. Pull requests are encouraged.
* As this is a work in progress, stability should not be expected. This
script has been a little buggy, but the implementation itself is one
I created for my own personal use and have found it to work perfectly
to suit my needs (i.e. tested on A10 iOS 13 via macOS 12).

## TODO
* Fix renaming snapshots automatically
* Check for gzip on SSH ramdisk
* Provide ramdisk building capabilities (submodule?)
* Determine whether .bootstrapped file should be added
